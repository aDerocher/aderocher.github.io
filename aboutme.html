                            Born and raised in Oregon, I moved to Portland in 2007 for college and have been enjoying the Pacific Northwest ever since!
                            <br></br>&emsp;
							I first started programming after college, using my savings to take about 3 months off from work and dedicating all my time to completing the Code Academy and Team Treehouse courses on web development. I enjoyed the work but even after all that I had learned, my portfolio wasnâ€™t strong enough to land me a job in the field. However, at my next job with HP, I found additional opportunities to continue flexing my web development skills from time to time. For example, I redesigned one of our internal websites for the Human Factors Lab, and created some scripts that automated a lot of tedium out of the shipping processes for the administrative assistant team. 
                            <br></br>&emsp;
                            The COVID pandemic led me to graduate from a Web Development bootcamp with perfect passing rates on all tests and projects, and from there I began my career as a software engineer. At Scan123 I was able to quickly pick up PHP and make contributions to both our client facing and internal tools. After joining a team at Intel, I and one other developer built an entire library application from scratch using React and Typescript. What I've learned and built so far has left me confident in my abilities to make meaningful contributions to professional teams, and I am looking forward to continuing to grow as a developer. </p>
