                            Born and raised in Oregon, I moved to Portland in 2007 for college and have been enjoying the Pacific Northwest ever since!
                            <br></br>&emsp;
							I started programming about a year after graduating college. I had been working in events and logistics part time all through school, and continued in events after graduation. However at some point I began to feel like I could challenge myself  more. That’s when an old friend of mine said he had been enjoying his job as a developer and suggested I teach myself to write code. He described solving puzzles all day in a field where many are self-taught, and the pay is pretty great too. I liked the sound of all of that, so I used my savings to take about 3 months off from working and ran full time through all the code academy and team treehouse courses on web development.
                            <br></br>&emsp;
                            I enjoyed the work but even after all that I had learned, my portfolio wasn’t strong enough to land me a job in the field, at least, not quickly enough.
                            BUT I did start working at a top-50 tech company. My job there mainly focused again around event coordination and logistics, but this time on often a much grander national and global scale. However there was enough additional opportunity for me to continue flexing my web development skills from time to time. A good example would be that I used the javascript/html/css I had learned to redesign one of our internal websites. The site is used for hosting things like a calendar, downloadable forms, the livestreaming of tests, and videos of past tests. Another good example was creating some scripts that automated a lot of tedium out of the shipping processes for the administrative assistant team.
                            <br></br>&emsp;
                            After 6 years at HP, the 2020 COVID pandemic wiped out the events industry, which resulted in my being laid off from HP.
                            After some reflecting, it dawned on me that this was the perfect time to get back into programming. I’ve recently graduated from a Web Development bootcamp with perfact passing rates on all tests and projects. What I've learned and built so far has left me confident in my abilities to make meaningful contributions to professional teams, and to continue to grow as a developer. I'm eager to take the next step forward and begin working in the software development field.
