                            <!-- <p>&emsp;As a kid, colored pencils were my go-to (crayons and markers are just so imprecise). In high school I branched out to sharpies, paint, ceramics, jewelry, photography, and digital media. I was typically making skateboard/snowboard designs, and often those involved some form of graffiti style. Once I was in college, a pencil and Adobe Creative Cloud became the main stays.
                            </p> -->
                            <p>&emsp;I always really enjoyed making graphics for boards and big pieces of graffiti and I think I still feel that style come through in my work. Lately I have been finding a lot of enjoyment in trying to make quality logo's for the fake company projects I have been making.
                            <br>&emsp; Below are some samples of my past works including pet projects, real-world design contributions, and even some that I created for online sale (online store <a href='https://www.redbubble.com/shop/ap/46898854' target='_blank' style="color:#337a85;">here</a>).

                        <div class="box alt col-4" style='border-top: 1px solid #337a85; display: flex; padding-top: 10px;'>

                            <p style='padding: 10px;'>&emsp;I grew up skateboarding, and my favorite board to ride was always an Alien Workshop. I always really liked the graphics they had as well, and though I might take a stab at creating some in their style. So I drew up this "DNA" series and sent them a copy. I haven't seen them on the market... yet!</p>

                        <div class="box alt col-4" style='border-top: 1px solid #337a85; display: flex; padding-top: 10px;'>
                            <p style='padding: 10px;'>&emsp;Another big influence on my artwork has been graffiti. I've been sketching my own pieces since middle school. This was one of my favorites I've done. I originally made the design on a wallet. I thought it made sense because thats what a wallet holds: Capital. Once the wallet broke down, I cleaned up the design in illustrator and made some T-Shirts out of it.</p>

                            <p style='padding: 10px;'>&emsp;While working in the HP design studio, I was proud to have contributed a design to this product. The small 'L' shaped indicators for ink cartridge placement were my design, and were proven the most effective graphic during user testing.</p>

                            <p style='padding: 10px;'>&emsp;This take on the Gadsden Flag is Jordan Peterson inspired to say "You should always work to better yourself, take responsibility for your own life, and become the most formitable lobster you can". It has by far been my best selling work.</p>

                            <p style='padding: 10px;'>&emsp;Aside from making clever T-Shirt designs, one of my favorite hobbies is rock climbing. So when the local climbing gym that I frequent was having a T-Shirt design contest, I had to give it a few entries. Although I did not take home the grand prize, I was happy with the design that I came up with.</p>

                            <p style='padding: 10px;'>&emsp;I started reading books on economics a few years ago, and immediately couldn't get enough of them. This was a design that I came up with as a tribute to my new favorite author, the economist Dr. Thomas Sowell.</p>

                            <p style='padding: 10px;'>&emsp;A friend of mine invited me to help make some new logos for their band. I really liked these designs I came up with. (The band has since... disbanded)</p>
